## Project Overview

In this post, I will explore the affect of deep learning in the field of dance and choreography. As someone who spends most of my time dancing and interacting with movement in my college career, this topic really spoke to me. I will be exploring the includion of different dance styles in the generation of choreographies.

## Three Most-Relevent Research Papers

1. #### EDGE: Editable Dance Generation From Music

    ([Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10658)) EDGE uses a transformer-based diffusion model paired with Jukebox, a strong music feature extractor, and confers powerful editing capabilities well-suited to dance, including joint-wise conditioning, and in-betweening. [1]

2. #### Dance Revolution: Long-Term Dance Generation with Music via Curriculum Learning

    ([Code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06119.pdf)) In this paper, we formalize the music-conditioned dance generation as a
    sequence-to-sequence learning problem and devise a novel seq2seq architecture to efficiently process long sequences of music features and capture the fine-grained correspondence between music and dance. [2]

3. #### The use of deep learning technology in dance movement generation
    ([Code](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.911469/full)) A dance movement generation algorithm based on deep learning is designed to extract the mapping between sound and motion features to solve these problems. First, the sound and motion features are extracted from music and dance videos, and then, the model is built. In addition, a generator module, a discriminator module, and a self-encoder module are added to make the dance movement smoother and consistent with the music. [3]
