## Introduction
Recent years have seen a tremendous advancement in deep fake technology, with new models and algorithms emerging that enable more convincing and realistic picture swaps. There are many uses for the skill of seamlessly and convincingly swapping out a person's face, from entertainment to political influence. But as deep fake technology spreads, so is the need to comprehend its strengths and weaknesses. The first model is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the second model is based on a modified version of the VGG16 CNN architecture. In this article, we will compare and contrast these two deep fake generation methods for picture swap. In order to learn more, we will evaluate each model's performance and take into account its advantages and disadvantages. We intend to provide light on the current state of deep fake creation for picture swap and add to ongoing discussions regarding its appropriate use by comparing these models side by side.

## Deep Fake Generation?
Deep fake generation is the process of producing synthetic media that closely resembles the appearance and behavior of actual people is known as "deep fake generation. This technology can produce incredibly lifelike images, films, and audio. For the intention of limiting the scope of the article, we will focus on pictures swaps. Face swapping is a specific type of deep fake generation that involves replacing one person's face with another person's face in an image or video. 

Face swapping typically entails feeding the network pairs of photos, each of which has the face of one person and the face of another. The network then learns to recognize the features and characteristics of each person's face and the relationship between them.

Once trained, the face swap model can be used to create new pictures or movies with the faces of two persons switched. It is feasible to create highly realistic face swaps that are challenging to discern from actual photographs by carefully tweaking the network's parameters after training it on a sizable collection of facial images.
