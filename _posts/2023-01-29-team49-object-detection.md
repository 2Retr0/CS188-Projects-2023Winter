# Study of Object Detection Techniques using MMDetection Toolkit

## Introduction
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to security and surveillance systems. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for object detection, with numerous techniques developed over the years. In this project, we aim to implement and compare multiple recent object detection techniques using the MMDetection library, including two-stage detectors (e.g., R-CNN), one-stage detectors (e.g., YOLO, SSD), and anchor-free detectors (e.g., FCOS, CenterNet).

## Objectives

* To implement and evaluate the performance of different object detection techniques using MMDetection.
* To compare the performance of two-stage detectors, one-stage detectors, and anchor-free detectors on various benchmark datasets.
* To gain insights into the strengths and limitations of different object detection methods and identify the methods that work best for specialized datasets.

## Data

We will evaluate the performance of the implemented methods on popular benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC, COCO. We also intend to apply the best performing algorithms to a specialized dataset, to be determined.

## Outcomes

* A comprehensive comparison of different object detection techniques.
* Recommendations for the use of specific object detection methods for various applications and datasets.
* Insights into the strengths and limitations of different object detection methods and the future directions of research in this area.
* An end-to-end object detection system for the specialized dataset we find to be most promising.
