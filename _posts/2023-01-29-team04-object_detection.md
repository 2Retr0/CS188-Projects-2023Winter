## Object Detection Algorithms
For our project, we have chosen to focus on object detection algorithms. We are interested in detecting everyday objects in a variety of settings. We want to compare the different objection detection algorithms and determine their weakpoints. To innovate, we are interested in creating our own dataset focused on these weakpoints or perhaps adding our own model training methods or adjusting hyperparameters to adjust the algorithm to function in different scenarios.
