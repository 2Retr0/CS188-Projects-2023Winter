> One in five Americans develop skin cancer within their lifespans, and roughly 10% of diagnoses is melanoma. Given its degenerative nature, early detection and screening can increase odds of remission. Doctors are still unable to detect if many lesions are cancerous by eye, resorting to invasive biopsies, but with current technologies and data available, neural networks have vasly outperformed doctors in diagnoses. In this blog post, we will explore avenues to improve current neural networks in their diagnosis of melanoma.

## Main Content

Many researchers have already provided strong models to analyze and detect melanoma. Alam Milton analyzed melanoma using an ensemble of neural networks with code provided [here](https://github.com/miltonbd/ISIC_2018_classification). Melanoma detection also has models that can outperform models, such as Pham et al's [here](https://github.com/riseoGit/melanoma-prediction/). Lastly, segmentation is also an area of need to analyze skin images, and Gorriz et. al tackle it [here](https://github.com/imatge-upc/medical-2017-nipsw). We aim to integrate these studies and code repos among others to contribute to a stronger model.
